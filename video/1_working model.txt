In this video, we kick off with a brief intro to a small dome dam project. To start, I activate my environment by entering a command, and a basic UI appears. The main function is demonstrated by choosing a file, either a video or an image.

Let's say I opt for an image. After uploading, the model predicts elements like HR or SPO2 within it. Meanwhile, the presenter shares a video that has been processed by the model. They emphasize the positive results, especially in detecting ECG and SPO2, showcasing the accuracy.

Towards the end, the presenter highlights some key metrics - 0.86 for one parameter and 0.92 for another. They express satisfaction with the results and suggest that the final outcome will be available soon. That wraps up the video with a thank you.
